## 1st Slide Inserting photos
The code for placing a photo in the center of the slide is much easier than trying to place it somewhere else specifically.
<center> ![Mountain](nature.jpg) <center>

## 2nd Slide Inserting Photos with Coordinate System
However, there is a code that has been provided to use that should make it much easier.
 \begin{picture}(320,250)
 \put(85,75){\includegraphics[height=6cm]
 {nature.jpg}}
 \put(00,60){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}
 {Figure Caption goes here}
 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}
 

## 3rd Slide Incremental slides
- My first point is that this is pretty easy
- My second point is that I hope to master Beamer Slides for future use
- My third point is that this is a very quick way to make professional looking presentations.

## 4th Slide Placing all Bullet Points on One Slide
>- Typing in an extra carrot seems like it would take a long time but it's not that bad
>- Formatting is so much quicker in Beamer slides
>- This is the third bullet point

## 5th Slide Making Color Text
To make colored text you need to only type in a few extra words using LaTex language


> - Color Examples
> - \color{purple} Purple is Bright 
> - \color{Green}  Green is a good highlight 
> - \color{red}  More color changes \color{black}

> -  Back to normal colors 
> - \color{orange} Switching colors is easy too!

## 6th Slide Placing a Caption Below a photo
<center> ![Mountain](nature.jpg) <center>
This hopefully makes the caption below the photo?

##7th Slide Placing a Caption Inside the Photo
 \begin{picture}(320,250)
 \put(85,75){\includegraphics[height=6cm]
 {nature.jpg}}
 \put(80,70){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}
 {Figure Caption goes here}
 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}

## 8th Slide with R Output
