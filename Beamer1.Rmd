## Incremental Bullet Points
- Writing just dashes can form incremental bullet points
- They appear one by on in order to emphasis points
- A simple symbol insertion can block incremental bullet points


## Disrupting Incremental Bullet Points
>- A little forward carrot keeps the bullets from appearing
>- Instead they all stay on the screen at the same time
>- The carrot locks all of the bullets on screen, unlike regular dashes

##Inserting a picture
Adding a picture in center can be done like so
<center> ![Nature](nature.jpg) <center>

## Using R Outputs
A random scatter plot should appear below:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
var1 <-runif(10)
var2 <- runif(10)
qplot(x=var1, y=var2)
```
