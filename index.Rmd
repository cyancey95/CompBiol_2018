 Hi, my name is Colleen Yancey and I am an Undergraduate Researcher with the Adair Lab Group at the University of Vermont. I am interested in studying microbial communities and their response to extreme weather events in a changing world. I am particularly interested in the effects that extreme ice storms have on mycorrhizal symbiosis with trees in North American hardwood forests, as well as the impacts of extreme rain events on denitrifying microbial communities in riparian zones.
